In this article, you will learn to create a datetime object from a string (with the help of examples).  


The  `strptime()`  method creates a  [datetime](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime#datetime)  object from the given string.

**Note:**  You cannot create  `datetime`  object from every string. The string needs to be in a certain format.

----------

## Example 1: string to datetime object

```py
from datetime import datetime

date_string = "21 June, 2018"

print("date_string =", date_string)
print("type of date_string =", type(date_string))

date_object = datetime.strptime(date_string, "%d %B, %Y")

print("date_object =", date_object)
print("type of date_object =", type(date_object))
```

When you run the program, the output will be:
```
date_string = 21 June, 2018
type of date_string = <class 'str'>
date_object = 2018-06-21 00:00:00
type of date_object = <class 'datetime.datetime'> 
```

### How strptime() works?

The  `strptime()`  class method takes two arguments:

-   string (that be converted to datetime)
-   format code

Based on the string and format code used, the method returns its equivalent  `datetime`  object.

In the above example:

![How strptime() works in Python?](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/python-strptime.jpg)

Here,

-   `%d`  - Represents the day of the month.  **Example:**  01, 02, ..., 31
-   `%B`  - Month's name in full.  **Example:**  January, February etc.
-   `%Y`  - Year in four digits.  **Example:**  2018, 2019 etc.

----------

## Example 2: string to datetime object

```py
from datetime import datetime

dt_string = "12/11/2018 09:15:32"

# Considering date is in dd/mm/yyyy format
dt_object1 = datetime.strptime(dt_string, "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")
print("dt_object1 =", dt_object1)

# Considering date is in mm/dd/yyyy format
dt_object2 = datetime.strptime(dt_string, "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S")
print("dt_object2 =", dt_object2)
```

When you run the program, the output will be:
```
dt_object1 = 2018-11-12 09:15:32
dt_object2 = 2018-12-11 09:15:32 
```

### ValueError in strptime()

If the string (first argument) and the format code (second argument) passed to the  `strptime()`  doesn't match, you will get  `ValueError`. For example:

```py
from datetime import datetime

date_string = "12/11/2018"
date_object = datetime.strptime(date_string, "%d %m %Y")

print("date_object =", date_object)
```

If you run this program, you will get an error.
```
ValueError: time data '12/11/2018' does not match format '%d %m %Y' 
```
